█ Problem Statement:
The proliferation of spam SMS messages poses a significant nuisance and security threat to mobile phone users. To combat this issue, we aim to build a predictive model that can automatically classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or non-spam.

█ Dataset:
The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham. Each message is accompanied by its corresponding label, indicating whether it is spam or not.

█ Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning:
   - 🐼 Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
   - 🔢 NumPy: For numerical operations on the data.

2. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - 🐼 Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - 📊 Matplotlib: For creating static plots and visualizations.
   - 📈 Seaborn: For creating more advanced visualizations.
     
3. Text Preprocessing:
   - 📜 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
   - 📊 Scikit-learn: For text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

4. Model Building:
   - 🧠 Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.
   
5. Evaluation:
   - 🧾 Scikit-learn: For evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

6. Improvement:
   - 🛠️ Feature Engineering: Utilize techniques such as feature scaling, feature selection, and feature creation to enhance model performance.

█ Additional Technologies:
   - 🌐 Streamlit: For building the web application to showcase the project.
   - 🌐 Streamlit Cloud: For hosting the web application online.

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to develop a robust SMS spam classification model, covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and improvement phases. Streamlit is used for creating and hosting the web application to demonstrate the project's results.
